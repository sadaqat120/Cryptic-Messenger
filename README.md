# Cryptic-Messenger

CrypticMessenger offers a simple yet effective solution for encrypting and decrypting messages, ensuring privacy and confidentiality. With its intuitive interface, users can easily encode their messages before sending and decode received messages for secure communication.

## Features

- **Encryption:** Encrypt messages using a custom algorithm and key.
- **Decryption:** Decrypt encrypted messages to retrieve the original content.
- **Secure Communication:** Safeguard sensitive information during transmission.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Easy-to-use program for encoding and decoding messages.

## How It Works

CrypticMessenger utilizes a custom encryption algorithm and key to transform plain text messages into unreadable ciphertext. The encrypted message can then be safely transmitted to the intended recipient. Upon receiving the encrypted message, the recipient can use the same program and key to decrypt the ciphertext and retrieve the original content.

## Dependencies

CrypticMessenger requires Python to run. No additional dependencies are needed.
